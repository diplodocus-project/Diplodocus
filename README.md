Diplodocus
==========
Change the way you educate

Diplodocus is a platform that wishes to help future students chose what they want to study.

We want to gather and map all data that is necessary for a student when choosing his future studies: professional insertion of different type of diplomas, cost of living, opportunity for internships, etc. 


## Installation
To install, start by
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Nota : We highly recommend to install Diplodocus into a virtualenv in order to keep your system Python environment clean
from our nasty stuff and dependencies.

Some dependencies may fail being automatically built by pip. Like Kartograph which relies on polygon lib. Or pyzmq,
which depends on zeromq.
