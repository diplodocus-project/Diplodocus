Diplodocus
==========

Change the way you educate

## Installation
To install, start by
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Nota : We highly recommend to install Diplodocus into a virtualenv in order to keep your system Python environment clean
from our nasty stuff and dependencies.

Some dependencies may fail being automatically built by pip. Like Kartograph which relies on polygon lib. Or pyzmq,
which depends on zeromq.
